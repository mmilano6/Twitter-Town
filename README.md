# Twitter-Town
what news is real news


Twitter Town examines how fake news has become so prevalent that distinguishing between what is real and fake is becoming increasingly difficult. Recently, “reputable” news sources have reported fake news as real, which then was further distributed by social media users, and even other news sources. On December 5, 2016 a man with an assault rifle entered the Washington D.C. restaurant Comet Ping Pong to “self-investigate” Pizzagate, a fake news story that was perpetuated by social media, and was even tweeted about by General Mike Flynn (Donald Trump’s pick for national security adviser). This virality has been incorrectly attributed by large amounts of the public as an indicator for accuracy.

Twitter Town was started with a trip to the Salton Sea. On the way there my car got a pretty severe flat tire and left me (and four other classmates) stranded in the Inland Empire. But while waiting for the repairs, I was killing time looking at facebook and twitter. During this time I came across a few articles relating to fake news. The first was discussing how students could not differentiate between real and fake news. The second was an article about how CNN aired 30 minutes of pornography, and that FOX news actually reported that it was true. (it was not true, and they changed the article) The third article, mentioned above, was about what is now called Pizzagate, where a man with an assault rifle entered a restaurant to “self-investigate” a child sex ring based on false information.

These three articles really pointed out a near future tipping point, that in many ways is already starting to unravel, where the distinction between real news and fake news will be completely impossible to make. It would become complete chaos, and no one would be able to tell what is true. 

I wanted to explore this concept through a simulation where I would be able to populate the simulation with actual live tweets. Twitter is a big factor in the virality of fake news, and the idea that a single tweet can spread so much false information made it seem like the perfect foundation for my simulation. 

I quickly realized that the twitter API is extremely difficult to work with, and that many have tried and failed. However after several days of searching and altering code, I found a Unity project that accessed Twitter's API. After a little more work (another day or so) I got the Unity project to pull tweets, from a location specified by the user, and to display them on screen.
